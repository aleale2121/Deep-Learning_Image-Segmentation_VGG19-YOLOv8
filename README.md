# Deep-Learning_Image-Segmentation_VGG19-YOLOv8

This repository contains implementations of image segmentation using two advanced deep-learning models, YOLOv8 and VGG19. Each project demonstrates distinct approaches and techniques for segmenting images into meaningful regions.

## YOLOv8 Image Segmentation

This project leverages the YOLOv8 model for real-time object detection and segmentation. It includes a web application built with Streamlit, which allows users to upload images and view segmented outputs interactively. This project highlights YOLOv8's capabilities in handling segmentation tasks efficiently.

## VGG19 Image Segmentation

Showcases using the VGG19 deep convolutional neural network for image segmentation through transfer learning. This project demonstrates feature extraction and fine-tuning techniques to adapt the VGG19 model for precise segmentation of images.
